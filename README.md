## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
The application also displays a map image of the city if the latitude and longitude information is available. It manages city information, user input, map display, and error messages. It renders the header, navigation links, an ExploreForm component for user input, and a Card component to display the city information and map image. It includes an input field and a button for triggering the retrieval of city data. It also handles making API requests to retrieve city information based on the user's input. The problem domain of this application seems to be related to location-based services or city information retrieval. The application allows users to explore and obtain details about different cities. It utilizes the LocationIQ API to fetch the necessary data, including latitude, longitude, and city name.


The purpose of building this application could be to provide a user-friendly interface for users to quickly access information about cities, such as geographical coordinates, in an interactive and visually appealing manner. This could be useful for various scenarios like trip planning, finding nearby attractions, or simply gaining general knowledge about different cities.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
